    "1. Open the command line to this directory\n",

    "We are importing a module called first_module, by now you should know what we mean by importing. Then we are calling functions inside the module we imported. Pls take note of how we imported the module.\n",

    "##### Notes\n",
    "1. We did not add the extension of the module because it is not needed. \n",
    "2. We accessed the functions inside the module by calling the function through the module name on the import - meaning that because we imported first_module it is first_module that we will use to access the functions inside the module. if the module were to have a different name eg. import go_module, it is go_module we will use to access the functions and properties defined in the go_module\n",

    "1. Open the command line to the directory where you have the first_module.py\n",
    "2. Then enter in to the python shell\n",

    "4. Access functions inside first_module like this"
